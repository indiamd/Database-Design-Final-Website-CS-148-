        <h3>Fun Fact...</h3>
            <p class="aboutParagraph2">In 2010, President Obama and his family visited Asheville, NC, and ate at the 12 Bones Smokehouse where Bob's artwork was on display at the time. These two images show of when Obama was in the restaurant with paintings on the wall behind. Both the portrait and the monkey pieces were painted by none other than Bob Davis himself.</p>
